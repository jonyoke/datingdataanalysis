# datingdataanalysis
Analysis of dating website data. Built as boot.dev first personal project.  First time using Claude Code.

The goal of this project is to find, and use publically available data from dating websites (probably two specific files from OKCupid) and analyze the data.

I'm interested to see if there are certain segements of the population that are more frequently seen in men and women, and if some cities more often see certain demographics than others.

I may introduce a GUI. TBD.

Part of the learning experience of this project is to try / learn Claude Code.
